VideoGameSearch

By Brandon Palomino

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you looking for a better way to learn more about games? This program should allow users/gamers 
to find specific games that they want to learn. They can easily search a game by category like horror, action/adventure, 
rpg, etc. Once they find the game they could read upon the decription, the history, characters, any previous or future installments, 
and many more details of it. 

Comments For The Project

I have tried to install derby on Mac, but it was quite difficult. So, I did it on the windows side of Parallels. 
It wasn't that hard because I was able to follow your tutorial on Youtube, which were very helpful.
